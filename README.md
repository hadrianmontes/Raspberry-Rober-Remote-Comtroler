# Raspberry-Rober-Remote-Comtroler
A pair of server-client controler to control a raspberry-pi motored rober from a computer over the network.

The motors are controlled by Adafruit DC and Stepper Motor HAT for
Raspberry Pi. In the side of the client a PS4 joystick is used for
controlling the raspberry. However the instructions may be sended to
the raspberry pi with another method with a little bit of coding.
